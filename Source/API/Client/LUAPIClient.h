/**
 `LUAPIClient` is used to perform requests to the LevelUp API.

 ## Setup

 Before using `LUAPIClient`, it must be set up with a valid API key. This is done with
 `setupWithAppID:APIKey:`.

 ## Issuing Requests

 The method `performRequest:success:failure:` is used to issue requests to the LevelUp's REST API.
 It performs these requests in the background, and then handles the responses. If the request is
 successful, the `success` block is called, passing in the result of the API call. If an error
 occurs, the `failure` block is called with an appropriate `NSError`.

 A API request is an instance of `LUAPIRequest` which has been generated using a request builder
 class. See the documentation for the request builder for information on specific API calls.

 ## Authentication

 When a user logs in, an access token is provided along with the user's ID. `LUAPIClient` needs to
 be given these values so that they can be included in API calls which require an authenticated
 user. Once stored, these values will be securely stored so that they will persist between
 application launches.

 ## Development Mode

 You can configure the SDK to run in "Development Mode" by configuring the SDK using
 `setupWithAppID:APIKey:developmentMode:` or by setting `developmentMode` to `YES`. When in
 Development Mode, all API requests will go to the LevelUp Sandbox server rather than the production
 API server. The Sandbox server allows you to test the API without charging any money. When in
 Development Mode, make sure your App ID and API Key are associated with a Sandbox App, configured at
 https://www.thelevelup.com/developer/sandbox/apps.

 ## Errors

 When an API call fails, the `failure` block passed to `performRequest:success:failure:` will be
 called with an `NSError` object containing additional information about the error. This error will
 have the domain `LUAPIErrorDomain`.

 ### Codes

 See `LUAPIErrorCode` in LUConstants.h for a list of possible error codes.

 ### User Info

 The `userInfo` dictionary for this `NSError` has keys for several pieces of information:

 - `LUAPIErrorKeyAPIErrors`: An optional array of `LUAPIError` objects returned by the server.
 - `LUAPIErrorKeyErrorMessage`: An optional error message from the server. If multiple errors were
 returned, this will only contain the first message. `LUAPIErrorKeyAPIErrors` can be used to see all
 errors.
 - `LUAPIErrorKeyJSONResponse`: An optional JSON response from the server.
 - `LUAPIErrorKeyOriginalError`: If this error was generated from another `NSError`, it is included
 under this key.
 - `LUAPIErrorKeyURLResponse`: An `NSURLResponse` containing the response.

 ## Example

    LUAPIRequest *request = [LUUserRequestFactory requestForCurrentUser];
    [[LUAPIClient sharedClient] performRequest:request
                                       success:^(LUUser *user) {
                                         NSLog(@"The current user is %@", user);
                                       }
                                       failure:^(NSError *error) {
                                         NSLog(@"Got an error: %@", error);
                                       }];
